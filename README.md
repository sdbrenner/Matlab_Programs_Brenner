# My Ocean Tools

This repository contains a variety of functions and tools to aid in oceaographic or limnologic research.  These include tools for data analysis and processing, simple modeling, and data visualization.  This repository will be continually evolving as I learn more and continue to build new tools and refine the existing ones.

Currently, all code is written for *Matlab*.  I am in the process of adding usage examples and syntax for each function.
