# Remote Sensing

These tools are built for working with various remote sensing data products.

## Polar Pathfinder

~~These tools are used for the Polar Pathfinder data product, available at:
https://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0116.~~

~~For a usage example, see  [example code](/Remote_Sensing/Polar_Pathfinder/Usage_Example/Example.m).~~

An updated Polar Pathfinder data product (version 4) was released in April, 2018.  This new version is now distributed in NetCDF files, which are easier to work with, and potentially incompatible with the functions that I've built and provided here.
