# COARE Algorithm

The COARE bulk algorithm is copied directly from
ftp://ftp1.esrl.noaa.gov/BLO/Air-Sea/bulkalg/cor3_5/
and is presented as-is.

These codes are based on:

*Fairall, C.W., E.F. Bradley, J.E. Hare, A.A. Grachev, and J.B. Edson (2003),
Bulk parameterization of air sea fluxes: updates and verification for the
COARE algorithm, J. Climate, 16, 571-590.*

For more information, see [coare30a_readme_1](coare30a_readme_1.pdf) produced by Chris Fairall and Frank Bradley.
